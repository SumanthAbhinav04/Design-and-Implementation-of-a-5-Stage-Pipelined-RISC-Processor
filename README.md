# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-5-Stage-Pipelined-RISC-Processor
Developed a complete 5-stage pipelined RISC processor in Verilog with modules like instruction memory, ALU, control unit, register file, and hazard detection/forwarding. Verified pipeline execution using waveform analysis and a custom testbench.
